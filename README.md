# Spark Machine Learning Lab using the Diamonds Dataset

This was an assignment I had to complete for my Big Data course at the University of Toronto during the Fall of 2019. Using the Databricks Diamonds dataset, I had to compare the holdout results of using the basic linear regression vs the pipelined forest regressor. In this assignment, I had to first clean the dataset by removing and/or cleaning columns that would be used as features, then I had to use both methods just mentioned to try and predict the dependent variable, the `price` of a diamond.
